If you read this page, it's because you are just about to add content on your Idiap personal webpage.

We have setup a very basic template in order to make it easy to customize, even if you are not a master in html. 

Of course, anyone with sufficient knowledge can improve existing template or start with new one.

For the persons that wants to keep it the way it is, let's start with a small how-to.

To add content in the default page, start by editing the file index.html. 

Open the file into your favorite editor "VI, gedit,  notepad ...".

Add your text in-between the 2 tags named "contentcontainer" where it says: <!--  ****************  insert content here below  *******************  -->


Basic html tags that can be used:
	<p></p> paragraph
	<strong></strong> text bold
	<i></i> text italic
	<h1></h1> header
	<h2></h2> header
	<h3></h3> header
	<br> breaking space
	<hr> breaking line

There is a style sheet attached to the index.html "styleidiap.css". This is where you can add your custom styles
